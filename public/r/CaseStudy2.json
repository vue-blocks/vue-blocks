One day, his advisors\n                        came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of money.\n                    </p>\n                    <h2>The King&apos;s Plan</h2>\n                    <p>\n                        The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with {{ \" \" }}\n                        <a href=\"#\">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the\n                        kingdom.\n                    </p>\n                    <blockquote>\n                        &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone enjoys a good\n                        joke, so it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the\n                        privilege.&rdquo;\n                    </blockquote>\n                    <h3>The Joke Tax</h3>\n                    <p>\n                        The king&apos;s subjects were not amused.

But there was one person who refused to let the\n                        king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named\n                        Jokester.\n                    </p>\n                    <h3>Jokester&apos;s Revolt</h3>\n                    <p>\n                        Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the night\n                        and leaving jokes all over the place: under the king&apos;s\n                        pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet.
