One day, his advisors\n                            came to him with a problem: the kingdom was running out of\n                            money.\n                        </p>\n                        <h2>The King&apos;s Plan</h2>\n                        <p>\n                            The king thought long and hard, and finally came up with{\" \"}\n                            <a href=\"#\">a brilliant plan</a>: he would tax the jokes in the\n                            kingdom.\n                        </p>\n                        <blockquote>\n                            &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;everyone enjoys a good\n                            joke, so it&apos;s only fair that they should pay for the\n                            privilege.&rdquo;\n                        </blockquote>\n                        <h3>The Joke Tax</h3>\n                        <p>\n                            The king&apos;s subjects were not amused.

But there was one person who refused to let the\n                            king&apos;s foolishness get him down: a court jester named\n                            Jokester.\n                        </p>\n                        <h3>Jokester&apos;s Revolt</h3>\n                        <p>\n                            Jokester began sneaking into the castle in the middle of the\n                            night and leaving jokes all over the place: under the\n                            king&apos;s pillow, in his soup, even in the royal toilet. The\n                            king was furious, but he couldn&apos;t seem to stop Jokester.\n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                            And then, one day, the people of the kingdom discovered that the\n                            jokes left by Jokester were so funny that they couldn&apos;t\n                            help but laugh.
