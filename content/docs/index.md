title: Welcome VueBlocks
description: ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Vue Blocks! Specially designed for Vue developers, Vue Blocks is a powerful toolkit for building block-based components, helping you create Vue applications more efficiently and flexiblyâ€”especially in scenarios such as rapid prototyping, complex UI decomposition, and component reuseâ€”significantly saving your development time and effort.

## Why copy and paste?

- An increasingly popular trend adopted by modern developers.
- Zero dependency, can be used as is or adjusted freely.
- Customize and expand to meet your needs.
- Directly access styles, behaviors, and logic.

## Core design concept

- **Modular splitting** - Break the "integrated" development model of the page, decompose the functions into fine-grained blocks, and effectively reduce the degree of code coupling.
- **Configurable** - Each block supports flexible configuration of style, data and behavior through props, and can be adapted to different business scenarios without modifying the source code.
- **Out of the box** - equipped with a rich variety of commonly used Blocks (such as form blocks, list blocks, pop-up blocks, navigation blocks, etc.), covering 80% of common business scenarios.
- **Easy to expand** - Support custom Block development, can quickly access the common components accumulated in the project to create a unique block library.

## What can Vue Blocks help you with?

Whether it's for personal projects, enterprise applications, or rapid prototyping, Vue Blocks provides the power to:

- **Quick setup** No need to write infrastructure code, directly select the required components from the Block library (such as "search form block" and "table list block"), adjust the style and logic through configuration options, and complete the core functionality of a full page in a few minutes.
- **Reducing collaboration costs** Team members can develop based on a unified Block specification to avoid "reinventing the wheel". When new people take over the project, they only need to understand the configuration rules of Block, without reading through the complex business code, and get started quickly.
- **Increase efficiency** - Build pages quickly and easily. Instead of writing infrastructure code from scratch, just select the required components from the Block library, adjust the style and logic through configuration options, and complete the core functionality of a complete page.
- **Flexible business expansion** - Easily extend the business, just select the required components from the Block library, adjust the style and logic through the configuration items, and complete the core functions of a complete page.
